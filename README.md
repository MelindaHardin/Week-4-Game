What the project does

In this project, the player will attempt to match the provided number in the green box by clicking the crystals which increase the value, getting them closer to the goal number.  If they match the number with out going over, they win.  If they go over the provided number, they lose.  


Why the project is useful

This project was useful for me as it helped me understand "functions" and scope.  I have struggled with understanding functions and feel more confident after this project. 

The most challenging aspect of this project was resetting the scores.
